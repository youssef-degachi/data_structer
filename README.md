# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains my journey of learning and implementing the core data structures, ranging from linked lists to graphs and hashmaps, using C++. Throughout this project, I focus on understanding the fundamental principles behind each data structure by writing code and solving related exercises.

## My Learning Process

I started with the basics, gradually building my knowledge through hands-on experience with each data structure. The key structures I've worked with include:

- **Linked List**: Implemented singly and doubly linked lists to understand the concepts of dynamic memory allocation, node manipulation, and traversal techniques.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implemented these using both arrays and linked lists to understand their LIFO and FIFO behavior, and how to use them in real-world applications.
- **Hashmaps**: Explored how hashmaps (also known as hash tables) work by using hashing functions to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Trees**: Covered binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Graphs**: Worked on implementing and traversing graphs using both adjacency matrices and adjacency lists, covering algorithms like BFS and DFS.

## Exercises & Solutions

As part of my learning process, I solved various exercises for each data structure to reinforce my understanding and gain practical experience. These exercises include:

- Implementing insertion, deletion, and search operations
- Solving common problems such as reversing a linked list, finding the shortest path in a graph, and detecting cycles in a graph
- Optimizing performance in terms of time and space complexity
- Applying concepts in real-life problem-solving scenarios

Through these exercises and their solutions, I gained a deeper understanding of the theoretical aspects of data structures and how they can be applied in different situations. This repository showcases my progress, code implementations, and the lessons I learned along the way.
